## Getting started
### Installation & Configuration

Follow [this simple guide on our wiki.](https://github.com/gfduszynski/cm-rgb/wiki/1.-Installation-&-Configuration)

### Usage

Package comes with two scripts ``cm-rgb-cli`` and ``cm-rgb-monitor``.  

``cm-rgb-cli`` allows for fine grained control of each individual zone including [turning off the LED's](https://github.com/gfduszynski/cm-rgb/wiki/2.-CLI-usage#3-turning-all-zones-off) completely.

Check out the [examples in our wiki](https://github.com/gfduszynski/cm-rgb/wiki/2.-CLI-usage).

``cm-rgb-gui`` GUI interface that serves the purpose of simplifying the usage of [cm-rgb-cli] (thanks to [groovykiwi](https://github.com/groovykiwi))

``cm-rgb-monitor`` allows for displaying cpu utilization with ring LED's, along with temperature (thanks to [mpsdskd](https://github.com/mpsdskd)).

Combining the cli + monitor can create neat transition from powering your system right to booting your OS.

Check out the [examples in our wiki](https://github.com/gfduszynski/cm-rgb/wiki/3.-Monitor-usage).
